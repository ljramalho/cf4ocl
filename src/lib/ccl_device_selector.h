/**
 * @defgroup CCL_DEVICE_SELECTOR Device selector
 *
 * This module offers a mechanism for selecting OpenCL devices, mainly for
 * context creation, although its functionality can be used for other purposes.
 *
 * The ::ccl_context_new_from_filters_full() context wrapper constructor (and
 * the ::ccl_context_new_from_filters() macro) accepts a ::CCLDevSelFilters
 * object containing a set of filters. These filters define which devices can be
 * used in the context. Instances of ::CCLDevSelFilters must be initialized to
 * NULL:
 *
 * @dontinclude device_filter.c
 * @skipline cf4ocl objects
 * @until CCLDevSelDevices devices
 *
 * Filters can then be added to the ::CCLDevSelFilters object with the
 * ::ccl_devsel_add_dep_filter() and ::ccl_devsel_add_indep_filter() functions,
 * which add @ref CCL_DEVICE_SELECTOR_DEP_FILTERS "dependent" or
 * @ref CCL_DEVICE_SELECTOR_INDEP_FILTERS "independent" filters, respectively.
 * Filters are processed in the order in which they are added. The next example
 * shows how to add an independent and a dependent filter to the
 * ::CCLDevSelFilters object:
 *
 * @skipline Add indep
 * @until ccl_devsel_add_dep
 *
 * At this stage, the most common use for the ::CCLDevSelFilters object
 * is to pass it to a context wrapper constructor:
 *
 * @skipline Create context
 * @until ctx =
 *
 * @skipline Free context
 * @until ccl_context_destroy
 *
 * However, the ::CCLDevSelFilters object can also be used for explicit
 * device selection:
 *
 * @skipline Perform device selection
 * @until devices =
 *
 * The ::CCLDevSelDevices object represented by `devices` is just a
 * [GLib pointer array](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Pointer-Arrays.html#GPtrArray),
 * so we have direct access to the list of device wrappers and its size.
 * For example, let us list the filtered devices by name:
 *
 * @skipline List selected
 * @until &err);
 *
 * @skipline printf(
 * @until For
 * @skipline If
 * @until ccl_devsel_devices_destroy
 *
 * ::CCLDevSelFilters objects are automatically freed and reset to `NULL` when
 * passed to context wrapper constructors or to the ::ccl_devsel_select()
 * function.
 *
 * See the complete example @ref device_filter.c "here".
 *
 * The device selector module provides two additional helper functions which
 * return and print a list of all OpenCL devices available in the system,
 * respectively:
 *
 * * ::ccl_devsel_get_device_strings()
 * * ::ccl_devsel_print_device_strings()
 *
 * Finally, the device selector module also offers the
 * ::ccl_devsel_devices_new() function, which returns a ::CCLDevSelDevices
 * object containing device wrappers for all OpenCL devices in the system. This
 * array should not be modified directly, and when no longer required, should be
 * freed with ::ccl_devsel_devices_destroy().

 *
 * @code{.c}

 * unsigned int len;
 * @endcode
 *
 * The `pdata` field is the array itself, while `len` specifies the length of

 *
 * @code{.c}
 * CCLDeviceWrapper * dev;
 * CCLDevSelDevice devices;
 * @endcode
 * @code{.c}
 * dev = (CCLDeviceWrapper *) devices->pdata[0];
