/**
 * @defgroup CCL_PLATFORMS Platforms
 *
 * The platforms module provides functionality for managing the OpenCL
 * platforms available in the system.
 *
 * The ::ccl_platforms_new() function returns a list of platforms
 * available in the system. The ::ccl_platforms_count() can be used to
 * get the number of platforms in the list, while the
 * ::ccl_platforms_get() will return the @f$i^{th}@f$ platform.
 *
 *  _Example:_
 *
 * @dontinclude list_devices.c
 * @skipline cf4ocl objects
 * @until CCLPlatform * platf;
 *
 * @skipline Other variables
 * @until cl_uint num_platfs;
 * @skipline CCLErr * err = NULL;
 *
 * @skipline Get all platforms in system
 * @until platf_list = ccl_platforms_new(&err);
 *
 * @skipline Get number of platforms in system
 * @until num_platfs = ccl_platforms_count
 *
 * @skipline Cycle through platforms
 * @until platf = ccl_platforms_get
 *
 * @skipline Cycle platforms
 * @until ccl_platforms_destroy
 *
