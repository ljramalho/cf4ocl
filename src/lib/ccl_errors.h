/**
 * @defgroup CCL_ERRORS Errors
 *
 * This module offers a function to convert OpenCL error codes into
 * human-readable strings. It is widely used by other _cf4ocl_
 * modules, but may also be useful to client code which directly uses
 * OpenCL functions.
 *
 * _Example:_
 *
 * ```c
 * cl_int status;
 * cl_event event;
 * ```
 *
 * ```c
 * status = clWaitForEvents(1, &event);
 * if (status != CL_SUCCESS) {
 *     fprintf(stderr, "OpenCL error %d: %s", status, ccl_err(status));
 * }
 * ```
