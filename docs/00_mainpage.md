# Introduction {#intro}

@brief _cf4ocl_, a C Framework for OpenCL

## Overview {#intro_overview}

The C Framework for OpenCL, _cf4ocl_, is a cross-platform pure C object-oriented
framework for developing and benchmarking [OpenCL][] projects. It aims to:

1. Promote the rapid development of OpenCL programs in C, with support for C++.
2. Assist in the benchmarking of OpenCL events, such as kernel execution and
data transfers.
3. Simplify the analysis of the OpenCL environment and of kernel requirements.

## Features {#intro_features}

* Object-oriented interface to the OpenCL API
  * New/destroy functions, no direct memory alloc/free
  * Easy (and extensible) device selection
  * Simple event dependency mechanism
  * User-friendly error management
* OpenCL version and platform independent
* Integrated profiling
* Advanced device query utility
* Offline kernel compiler and linker

## Small example

The example below shows a clean and fast way to create an OpenCL context with a
user-selected device:

```c
#include <cf4ocl2.h>
int main() {

    /* Variables. */
    CCLContext * ctx = NULL;

    /* Code. */
    ctx = ccl_context_new_from_menu(NULL);
    if (ctx == NULL) exit(-1);

    /* Destroy context wrapper. */
    ccl_context_destroy(ctx);

    return 0;
}
```

## Not yet integrated

A few OpenCL API calls, most of which introduced with OpenCL 2.1, are
[not yet integrated][enhancements] with _cf4ocl_. However, this functionality is
still available to client code, because _cf4ocl_ can be used simultaneously with
raw OpenCL objects and functions.
