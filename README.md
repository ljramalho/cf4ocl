News
====

*4 July 2016*

Version 2.1.0 is available for download in the [releases][] page.

Summary
=======

The C Framework for OpenCL, _cf4ocl_, is a cross-platform pure C object-oriented
framework for developing and benchmarking [OpenCL][] projects. It aims to:

1. Promote the rapid development of OpenCL host programs in C (with support for
C++) and avoid the tedious and error-prone boilerplate code usually required.
2. Assist in the benchmarking of OpenCL events, such as kernel execution and
data transfers. Profiling comes for **free** with _cf4ocl_.
3. Simplify the analysis of the OpenCL environment and of kernel requirements.
4. Allow for all levels of integration with existing OpenCL code: use as much or
as few of _cf4ocl_ required for your project, with full access to the underlying
OpenCL objects and functions at all times.

Features
========

* Object-oriented interface to the OpenCL API
  * New/destroy functions, no direct memory alloc/free
  * Easy (and extensible) device selection
  * Simple event dependency mechanism
  * User-friendly error management
* OpenCL version and platform independent
* Integrated profiling
* Advanced device query utility
* Offline kernel compiler and linker

Documentation
=============

* [User guide and API](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/)
* [Tutorial](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/tut.html)
* [Wiki](https://github.com/fakenmc/cf4ocl/wiki)
* [Utilities](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/utils.html)
* [Function list](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/funlist.html)
* [Library modules](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/modules.html)
* [Examples](http://www.fakenmc.com/cf4ocl/docs/latest/examples.html)

Feedback and collaboration
==========================

Download or clone _cf4ocl_,
[build and install it](https://github.com/fakenmc/cf4ocl/wiki/Build-and-install-from-source),
and [code](https://github.com/fakenmc/cf4ocl/wiki/Using-cf4ocl-in-a-new-project)
a small example, such as the one below, which shows a clean and fast way to
create an OpenCL context with a user-selected device:

```c
#include <cf4ocl2.h>
int main() {

    /* Variables. */
    CCLContext * ctx = NULL;

    /* Code. */
    ctx = ccl_context_new_from_menu(NULL);
    if (ctx == NULL) exit(-1);

    /* Destroy context wrapper. */
    ccl_context_destroy(ctx);

    return 0;
}
```

If you like this project and want to contribute, take a look at the existing
[issues][]. We also need help with [binary packaging][] for different OSes.
Other improvements or suggestions are of course, welcome. We appreciate any
feedback.

Not yet integrated
==================

A few OpenCL API calls, most of which introduced with OpenCL 2.1, are
[not yet integrated][enhancements] with _cf4ocl_. However, this functionality is
still available to client code, because _cf4ocl_ can be used simultaneously with
raw OpenCL objects and functions.
